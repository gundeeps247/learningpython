                    # Varibles and Data Types

#Here we used two variables name and age and used them in the print statements, to avoid the reptitive effort of recorrexting them if i needed to change name or age.
# NEW LEARNING: if you have to use + sign, i.e. cocatenate then the variable must be a string as you can't concatenate a string to string, not an int, so to avoid this problem we can , instead of + sign.

# name="Gundeep"
# age = "20"

# print("There once was a man named",name) # we can either use , or + 
# print("he was",age,"years old.")

# name = "Sukhman"#This an intresting thing as reassining name here changes the name after this point only the above values are not changed.
# print("He really likes the name " + name)
# print("but he didn't liked being " + age + ".")


# Datatypes include string, int, and boolean
