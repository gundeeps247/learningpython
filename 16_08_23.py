#                              PLAYING WITH NUMBERS

# #       simply printing numbers
# print(2)


# #         We can also perform simple arithmetic ops
# print(3*4+5)
# print(3*(4+5))
# print(10%3) #modulus


# #          Using variables
# my_num=5
# print(my_num)


# #            Converting the number into string
# my_num=5
# print(str(my_num))
# print(str(my_num)+" is my favourite number")
# the previous thing would not have been possible if we didn't convert the number into string


# #                       MATHS OPERATORS


# # abs-> absolute value
# my_num = -3
# print(abs(my_num))


# #  Power
# print(pow(3, 4))


# #  Max
# print(max(4, 6))


# #   Min
# print(min(4, 6))


# #   Round function
# print(round(3.55))


#                   Importing libraries

from math import *

# print(floor(3.7))


# print(ceil(3.8))


# print(sqrt(36))
